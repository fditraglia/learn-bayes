## Goals of this Presentation^[Unless otherwise indicated, all quotes are from Sims (2010).]

1. Summarize some key points from [Sims (2010) - Understanding Non-Bayesians](http://sims.princeton.edu/yftp/UndrstndgNnBsns/GewekeBookChpter.pdf).
2. Relate them to the broader discussion of Bayesian vs.\ Frequentist inference.

## Fun Facts 

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="70%"}

\vspace{2em}

- "Understanding Non-Bayesians" was originally written for the [Handbook of Bayesian Econometrics](https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199559084.001.0001) in 2010.
- Oxford University Press objected to Sims posting a pre-print on [his website](https://www.princeton.edu/~sims/).
- Sims favors open access and withdrew from the handbook in protest; the paper remains unpublished. 
- In 2011 [Sims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_A._Sims) was awarded the [Economics Nobel](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2011/summary/) for "understanding cause and effect in the macroeconomy."
- Take that OUP!

## Motivation: Why isn't everyone Bayesian?

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="70%"}
> Once one becomes used to thinking about inference from a Bayesian perspective, it becomes difficult to understand why many econometricians are uncomfortable with that way of thinking. But some very good econometricians are either firmly non-Bayesian or (more commonly these days) think of Bayesian approaches as a "tool" which might sometimes be appropriate, sometimes not.

\vspace{1em}

### Some Pedantry

Maybe we should call it "Bayes-Laplace" inference: [Laplace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Simon_Laplace#Analytic_theory_of_probabilities) developed what we would recognize as "Bayesian" inference.

## What is this paper about?


- Purpose: Articulate counterarguments to Bayesian perspective
- Some counterarguments are "easily dismissed"
- Others relate to deep questions about inference in infinite-dimensional spaces

\vspace{2em}

> My conclusion is that the Bayesian perspective is indeed universally applicable, but that "non-parametric" inference is hard, in ways about which both Bayesians and non-Bayesians are sometimes careless.

## Bayesian versus Frequentist Approaches

### Frequentist 
- "Insists on a sharp distinction between unobserved, but non-random 'parameters' and observable, random data."
- "Works entirely with the probability distributions of data, conditional on unknown parameters--estimators and test statistics, for example--and makes assertions about the distribution of those function of the data, conditional on parameters"

### Bayesian 
- "Treats everything as random before it is observed, and everything observed as, once observed, no longer random." 
- "Aims at assisting in constructing probability statements about anything as yet unobserved (including 'parameters') conditional on the observed data."

---

## Let's unpack this a bit: Frequentists 

- Condition on parameters; make probability statements that average over different *datasets* you could potentially observe.
- E.g. $X_1 ..., X_{100}$ is a random sample from a $\text{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)$ population with $\sigma=1$ known.
- "$\bar{X}_n \pm 1.96 \times \sigma/\sqrt{n}$ is a 95\% confidence interval for $\mu$." 
- Translation: In 95\% of the datasets we could possibly observe, the sample mean will land within about $\pm 0.2$ of the true (fixed and unknown) value of $\mu$.
- The observed interval $\bar{x} \pm 0.2$ either contains $\mu$ or doesn't: nothing is random after we have observed the data. 
- Traditional (Neyman-Pearson) inference is *pre-experimental*: inductive behavior rather than inductive inference.

---

## Let's unpack this a bit: Bayesians

- Condition on *observed data*; make probability statements that average over different *parameter values* that could potentially have generated the data.
- E.g. $X_1 ..., X_{100}$ is a random sample from a $\text{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)$ population with $\sigma=1$ known.
- Need a prior: just for simplicity choose a "vague" one e.g. $\mu \sim \text{N}(0, 10000)$
- "The posterior distribution of $\mu$ is (approximately) $\text{N}(\bar{x}, 1/100)$, so the 95\% highest posterior density interval (HPDI) for $\mu$ is approximately $\bar{x} \pm 0.2$." 
- Translation: Given the observed data, there is around a 95\% probability that the population mean $\mu$ lies within $\pm 0.2$ of the sample mean $\bar{x}$.
- The observed sample mean $\bar{x}$ is fixed and known; the population mean $\mu$ is unknown and treated as random.
- Bayesian inference is *post-experimental* (conditional): inductive inference under an assumed model given observed information.

## Differing Interpretations of Probability

- Crucial background to the differences between Bayesians and Frequentists.
- Math is the same either way (Kolmogorov Axioms) but meaning is different.
- Bayesians: **"Belief-type"**  interpretation. 
- Frequentists: **"Frequency-type"**  interpretation.
- Sims doesn't discuss this. The next two slides (including quotes) are based on Chapter 11 of [An Introduction to Probability and Inductive Logic](https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/an-introduction-to-probability-and-inductive-logic/EA38518337057366AD690C789DD546B8?utm_campaign=shareaholic&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=bookmark) by Ian Hacking.

## Belief-Type: "It is probable that the dinosaurs were made extinct by a giant asteroid hitting the earth."

### Interpersonal / Evidential: Keynes, Jeffreys, Jaynes 
- "Relative to the available evidence, the probability that the dinosaurs were made extinct by a giant asteroid hitting the earth is high--about 0.9."
- "She thinks that [the statement] is *interpersonal*--because it is about what is reasonable for any reasonable person to believe. And since the degree of belief should depend on the available *evidence* we call this *interpersonal/evidential*."

### Personal Degree of Belief: de Finetti, Savage
- "I personally am very confident that the dinosaurs were made extinct by a giant asteroid hitting earth."
- "If I had to make a bet on it, I would bet 9 to 1 that the dinosaurs were made extinct by a giant asteroid hitting the earth."

## Frequency-Type: "The probability of getting heads with this coin is 0.6." 

> The truth of this statement seems to have nothing to do with what be believe. We seem to be making a completely factual statement about a material object, namely the coin ... We may be saying something like:
>
>   - In repeated tossing, the *relative frequency* of heads settles down to a stable proportion, 6/10.
>   - The coin has a *tendency* to come down heads far more often than tails.
>   - It has a *propensity* or *disposition* to favor heads.
>   - Or we are saying something more basic about the asymmetry of the coin and the tossing device. We may be referring to the *geometry* and *physics* of the coin, which cause it to come down more often heads than tails.

## Why does Sims put the word "parameters" in quotes?

Poirier (1996) textbook on econometrics: chapter 5?

## Implications for Decision-Making

* Bayesian inference feeds naturally into decision-making under uncertainty
* Frequentist analysis does not directly provide probabilities for decision-makers

---

## Easily Dismissed Objections

1. **"Bayesian inference is subjective"**
   - Bayesians can take an "objective" approach by describing the likelihood
   - Good frequentist practice also involves informal use of prior beliefs

2. **"Bayesian inference is harder"**
   - Often easier to characterize optimal small-sample inference from Bayesian perspective
   - Frequentist asymptotic results can often be given Bayesian interpretations

---

## Less Easily Dismissed Objections

### Handy methods that seem un-Bayesian
* IV, GMM, sandwich estimators, kernel methods
* Can be given limited information Bayesian interpretations
* Involve implicit Bayesian judgments in asymptotic theory

---

## Challenges in Non-parametrics

* Infinite-dimensional parameter spaces
* Consistency issues in Bayesian inference
* Pitfalls in high-dimensional spaces:
  - Priors can be unintentionally dogmatic
  - Importance of careful prior specification

---

## Example: Angrist and Krueger (1991) Quarter of Birth

- The Wasserman problem is about non-parametrics and you can read about it here.
- But we don't need anything too exotic to see the issues Sims is talking about.
- If you're not an economist and don't know what instrumental variables is, here's a very quick introduction.
- Give the introduction.
- Then make the point of Chamberlain \& Imbens (1996)
- Point out that the Frequentist solution is also terrible in this case since it corresponds to an insane prior!
- Useful dialogue between Bayesians and Frequentists: what prior does the frequentist solution correspond to? Frequency properties of Bayesian estimators?

---

## Example 1: The Wasserman Problem

* Setup: Observing $(\xi, R, Y)$ with unobserved $\theta$ 
* Goal: Estimate $\psi = \mathbb{E}[\theta]$
* Bayesian approaches:
  1. Independence case
  2. Dependence case (sieve method)
  3. Limited information approach

---

## Critique of Wasserman's Conclusions

I probably still want to mention these points, but I don't really want to get into the Wasserman example since it won't be as familiar to the audience.

* Bayesian methods are not necessarily insensitive to data
* Importance of appropriate prior specification
* Pitfalls of high-dimensional parameter spaces

---

## Example 2: Robust Variance Estimates in Regression

Not sure how much I should say about this one, but if I do mention it then it might be worth mentioning the Leamer "White-washing" stuff along with the paper where he talks about the "sandwich" estimator versus GLS and something about when the point estimates will change.

* OLS with sandwich covariance matrix
* Efficiency bounds (Chamberlain, 1987)
* When is OLS with sandwich appropriate?
  - Large samples
  - Likely nonlinear regression function
  - Interest in best linear predictor

---

## Conclusion

* Bayesian perspective is universally applicable
* Importance of careful modeling in high-dimensional spaces
* Pragmatic Bayesian approach:
  - Recognize limitations of asymptotic approximations
  - Consider model improvements when appropriate
  - Use OLS with sandwich judiciously
